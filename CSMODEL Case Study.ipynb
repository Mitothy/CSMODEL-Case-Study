With 13 tailored performance indicators, the rankings evaluated four key proxies to present the learning, knowledge, research as well as international diversity dimensions. This year's scrutiny included looking at more than 121 million references from over 15.5 million scholarly articles, as well as survey input gleaned from 40,000 global academics. All told, the rankings culled through upwards of 680,000 data points derived from more than 2,500 participating schools.\n",

    "The `2023 World University Rankings` combine the use of web-scraping with institutional submission to collect the data. The data is then refined using several libraries such as the popular Python PANDAS dataframe. Multiple sources of data improve the scope and authority of the collected dataset. However, it must be mentioned here that missing data points are replaced with conservative estimates in order to avoid undue penalization introducing a potential bias.\n",

But the Academic Reputation Survey does introduce an exponential element keeping in mind its distinctily distributed data. This does add variation though but including subjectivity makes it prone to different interpretations and rendering possible.\n",
